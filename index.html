            Han, old buddy, do you read me?

                Did you hear that? They've shut down the main reactor. We'll be destroyed for sure. 
                This is madness! We're doomed! There'll be no escape for the Princess this time. 
                What's that? Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you? At last! Where have you been? They're heading in this direction. 
                What are we going to do? We'll be sent to the spice mine of Kessel or smashed into who knows what! 
                Wait a minute, where are you going? The Death Star plans are not in the main computer. 
                Where are those transmissions you intercepted? What have you done with those plans? We intercepted no transmissions. 
                Aaah., This is a consular ship.

                All troop carriers will assemble at the north entrance. The heavy transport ships will leave as soon as they're loaded.
                Only two fighter escorts per ship. The energy shield can only be opened for a short time, 
                so you'll have to stay very close to your transports. Two fighters against a Star Destroyer? 
                The ion cannon will fire several shots to make sure that any enemy ships will be out of your flight path.
                I am your father. No. No. That's not true! That's impossible! Search your feelings. You know it to be true. 
                No! No! No! Luke. You can destroy the Emperor.
